Portfolio: BI/DWH Modernization in Microsoft Fabric 

As a specialist in Business Intelligence and Data Warehousing, I’ve led scalable analytics solutions across industries. This portfolio showcases my transition into Microsoft Fabric translating legacy ETL logic into cloud-native pipelines, reusable semantic models, and operational dashboards. 



What I’ve Built 

Inventory Analytics Pipeline 

Modeled dimension and fact tables in Dataflow Gen2 

Simulated missing metrics (COGS, PhysicalCount, OrderShippedDate, Inventory Turnover, Unit Cost, Unit Sold, ...) 

Engineered dynamic flags: Stockout, Reorder, Overstock 

Built semantic models and Power BI dashboards with KPI cards and drillthroughs 


Customer Churn Workflow 

Implemented churn prediction using Notebooks(Python, Pyspark, SQL)

Generated synthetic data to accelerate development 

Cloned logic across business units for scalable delivery 


CI/CD and Version Control 

Git-based management of Power Query, DAX, and pipeline configs 

DevOps triggers for automated deployment and schema validation 

Highlights
- **Dataflows** – Automated ingestion pipelines using Power Query (M).
- **Notebooks** – Python and Spark-based transformations in Fabric.
- **Semantic Models** – Tabular models, measures, and relationships.
- **Dashboards** – Power BI reports with field parameters and scorecards.
- **CI/CD** – End-to-end deployment automation using YAML pipelines.
